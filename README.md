#This is a two-screen Christmas Card. 
#Find and drag the biggest star on the first screen then the second screen will be shown.
#On the second screen, there will be a group of dancing santa claus and shining greeting words with rotating stars.

#The code of drawing small santa claus, trees and stars are borrowed from http://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/advent11#
#The code of falling snow is borrowed from http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/83898
